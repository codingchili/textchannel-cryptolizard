Gateway for sending and receiving sms messages through your browser or using our API

This project is planned, development has not started yet.

#### Background
This projets allows anyone to turn their Android phone into an SMS gateway. Why would anyone like to do this? For starters, this makes it possible to send SMS in ways you could never dream of. With this piece of software it is possible to send and receive text messages in your browser. For example if you are sitting at your computer and receiving a text; it is now possible to avoid unlocking a slow Android device when you could have used your mechanical keyboard! Time saver! 

There is an additional problem, cell providers will often bake the costs of thousands of text messages into your monthly bill. In the meantime, SMS gateway providers are selling SMS at 0.15$ each. What if you could sell your unspent SMS messages to someone else? We are creating a marketplace to do this, driven by the power of crypto currency! Money saver!
